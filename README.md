# Optmized Map Rotation for Counter Strike Source Servers

An attempt at optimizing disk space usage on Counter-Strike: Source servers by downloading the map files off a cloud service mid-match and keeping only 1 or 2 map files locally on the server machine. Once the next map file has been downloaded, waits until a specified amount of time runs out and restarts the server, deleting the previous match's map.

Also planned discord integration so players can change/request maps mid match.

## TODO

* css server
